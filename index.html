            <h1>Welcome to Among Us</h1>
    
            <p>Crewmates must stay vigilant and vote the impostors out. </p>
            <p>Impostors need to "kill" all crewmates while avoiding being caught.</p>
                
    
            <h2>You are an IMPOSTOR.</h2>
            
            <p>Try to kill ALL crewmates before they complete their tasks but avoid getting voted out. 
                Make sure the kills are discrete so that crewmates don't discover your identity. </p>
    
            <h3>Different ways to kill crewmates (you can kill ONLY ONCE every 10 minutes):</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a selfie with a crewmate. It must be with ONLY ONE person per photo.</li>
                <li>Steal a crewmates personal item and put it in the tv room. (Text Alaa or Mo for them to confirm)</li>
                <li>Clink a glass with a crewmate. ONLY ONE person at a time. Text Alaa or Mo to confirm kill.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the start of the game you do not know who the other impostor(s) is/are, but you may be able to figure it out if you see them performing kills. 
                    You can choose to approach and create strategies or keep yourself hidden.</li>
                <li>If a meeting is called try to blend in with the crew and avoid getting voted out.</li>
                <li>As an imposter, you can also call an emergency meeting to throw crewmates off.</li>
            </ul>
